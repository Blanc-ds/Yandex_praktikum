# Project: Determination of a promising tariff for a telecom company.

## Project description
Based on the data of the mobile operator's customers, analyze customer behavior and find the optimal tariff. 
In order to adjust the advertising budget, the commercial department wants to understand which tariff brings the most money.

## The tools i used:
Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas, Python, SciPy, descriptive statistics, testing statistical hypotheses.


## Main conclusions:
Based on the data obtained as a result of the research (including the revenue received from customers), we can conclude that, although users of the "Smart" tariff pay a lower monthly fee compared to users of the "Ultra" tariff, they often spend resources of the upper limit, thereby greatly increasing the monthly bill for using Megaline's services.

Answering the question of the commercial department, we can say that it is necessary to focus on the "Smart" tariff and, accordingly, this particular tariff will be more rational to increase the advertising budget.

## Project status:
Complited.
