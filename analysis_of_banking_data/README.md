# Project: Research on the reliability of borrowers - analysis of bank data.

## Project Description
The customer is the credit department of the bank. 
It is necessary to find out whether the marital status and the number of the client's children affect the fact that the loan is repaid on time. Input data from the bank - statistics on clients' solvency. 
The research results will be taken into account when building a credit scoring model - a special system that assesses the ability of a potential borrower to repay a loan to a bank.

## The main tools that I used in the project:
Pandas, PyMystem3, Python, lemmatization, data preprocessing.
