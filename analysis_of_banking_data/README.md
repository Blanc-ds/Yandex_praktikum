# Project: Research on the reliability of borrowers - analysis of bank data.

## Project Description
The customer is the credit department of the bank. 
It is necessary to find out whether the marital status and the number of the client's children affect the fact that the loan is repaid on time. Input data from the bank - statistics on clients' solvency. 
The research results will be taken into account when building a credit scoring model - a special system that assesses the ability of a potential borrower to repay a loan to a bank.

## The main tools that I used in the project:
Pandas, PyMystem3, Python, lemmatization, data preprocessing.

## Main conclusions:
The highest percentage of the loan repayment on time was shown by the category of people who indicated that they had no children.
The smallest percentage of return rates is for people with one or two children. However, it is worth considering that the latter apply for a loan less often than people without children.

The highest percentage of loan repayment was shown by the category “widower / widow”, and the lowest - “not married”.
