# Identifying patterns in the video game market.

## Project description
Using historical data on sales of computer games, user and expert assessments, genres and platforms, identify patterns that determine the success of a game.

## The tools i used
Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas, Python, exploratory data analysis, descriptive statistics, data preprocessing, testing statistical hypotheses.

## Main conclusion:
Based on the data from previous periods, we have compiled the top 5 platforms, sales of which are expected to grow in 2017. You can also bet on the most popular genres and thus increase sales. 
A safe bet is to focus on products at the intersection of popular platforms and genres (such as PS4 and action genre). Along with this, it is worth highlighting the Japanese region, which, although it is subject to general trends, still has its own specifics.

## Project status:
Complete.
